    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Passionate about problem-solving and driven to excel, transforming gears
      from a Mechanical Engineering background to pursue my true passion, full
      stack web developer. My decision to invest in one of the top-rated web
      development courses in the UK reflects my unwavering commitment to
      mastering this dynamic field. What sets me apart is my ability to apply
      analytical thinking and attention to detail, honed in my previous academic
      journey. With strong problem-solving skills and a desire to continually
      learn and innovate, I am poised to make a meaningful impact as a junior
      software developer.
