<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Amin Mohamed, a passionate full stack web developer based in
  the UK. With a background in Mechanical Engineering, I discovered my love for
  coding through the use of MATLAB during my time at university, and I've been immersed in the world of
  programming ever since.
</p>

<p>
  I believe that the web is an endless canvas for creativity and innovation, and
  I'm dedicated to crafting seamless and engaging digital experiences that leave
  a lasting impression. Whether it's building responsive websites, optimising
  user interfaces, or delving into the intricacies of backend development, I
  thrive on the challenges and rewards of the ever-evolving tech landscape.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not coding, I find myself listening to sports podcasts, immersing myself in interesting documentaries, or getting lost in a good book.
  I'm also a huge fan of tech, and I'm always up for a
  friendly debate about the latest tech trends or the best programming
  languages.
</p>

<p>
  Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about
  all things web development â€“ I'd love to connect with you!
